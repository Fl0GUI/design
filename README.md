# What even is a design identity

(to me)

A design identity makes you bridge the gap between two separate entities. It associates your experiences of one entity with the next. It is the only remaining link when all else differs. 

I want the little crumbs I leave on this world to at least be coherent. I want that someone can form a bigger picture when looking at the little crumbs. I want an identity.

I'm also very bad at making any sort of decision when it comes to visuals. A pixel too wide or too far, a font to weird or too small. A bit off of the right colour. I don't know what decision to take and every decision looks like the wrong one.

### DESIGN

So what's the actual thing I want. 

Imagine the design of any user interface. It could be a mobile app, desktop application, or web page. The top most layer is exactly what you see. A section here a banner there. Everything has its place on your screen. And multiple screens form the application. This needs to be designed for every page for every use case. This isn't what I need.

The next layer consists of the components. There are text and input fields, buttons and icons. Creeping into the layer above are also modals and notifications. These are all building blocks to create complete screens. This isn't what I need.

The lowest layer is what ties everything together. And it is what I need. It is also what I know least of. It is also what I find the hardest to describe. There is of course the exact font to use, the colour pallette, spacings. But these are all details to allude to something intangible in nature. It is this something I can only accredit artists to master, and is completely out of my grasp.

I don't imagine my brain to be wired correctly to get this, so I still need tangible ideas and concepts to work with. I just need an artist that can assemble some rules that will guide me on this intangible path.

I guess "style" is a good way to describe it. I need a style. A style I can implement into components, that I can put on a screen to create an application, or a site, my desktop, or maybe even a text document. Perhaps an artist can take this style and transform it into pieces of art. Art to use as a representation as myself or my profile. Art to decorate a stream.

## COLOR

Color is important. It's what gives lives to ordinary objects. Without colour the world would be bland and uninteresting. Yet modern UIs all do away with colour.

#ffffff, #ffffff, #f4f2ee, #ffffff, #f7f7f8, #f0f2f5, #ffffff. These are the background colours of twitter, youtube, linkedin, desmos, twitch, facebook and discord. Only the most boring platform dares to go out of the f0-ff range of a colour channel, and it's in the colour the human eye is least susceptible to. The only bit of colour that distinguishes these sites are the colours of their logos, and these are black, red, blue, white, purple, blue and blue. Far from the most imaginative colours. 

I wanted to compare this age in colour design to paintings to say that, like classical art, graphic design must also follow trends. But no! Even paintings in the blandest of colours still play with light and dark to guide the gaze of onlookers and play with your emotions.

Sure, comparing graphic design to paintings might not be valid. Since websites, desktop applications and whatnot are meant to be functional. You look at them in order to find the piece of information you want as fast as possible. What if I compare it to architecture. Architecture is an art form, and most definitely functional. But no. Architecture is bigger than life, while you interact with your screen on a personal level. Much like with paintings. Also, architecture makes you feel, the screen I'm typing this on does not.

Colour holds a special place in graphic design. It's the furthest away from functionality than other aspects. Take the colour away and you're still left with the same information and functionality. Only leave the colours and... With nothing but colours, a piece of graphic media should be pretty.

The only pieces of graphic media where I can remember colours playing any role are games, and game UIs. I should collect some. Too bad my pc broke ):

## GRIDS

Grids, rectangles, straight lines. Everything is straight. And for a good reason. A rectangle is easy to fill, and can be filled with other rectangles. UIs come in boxes for the same reason that a room is a box; to hold other boxes in. You know that you can add another box to your box, just put it next to the rest.

One of the most atrocious examples of this is the menu bar. I have on on the top of the application I'm writing this in. There is a long box on the top, with 6 different boxes side to side. If I click on a box, another box appears. This box also holds boxes. These are now vertical. Some of these vertically stacked boxes can be expanded to a bigger box. This box is the same box holding the same vertically stacked boxes. Some of those can be expanded as well. There's a reason for this of course. For each box your eyes have to scan in one direction only. If you found something that matches what you search for you can look through the next box in a single direction as well. But what if you don't know what to search for? Then your eyes have to scan box after box after box, and this is tiring. This experience is made worse when the boxes are bigger, and are sectioned, and contain icons. If you have the misfortune of having visual studio installed, open it and look through all the boxes on the top.

What a better layout would be to search through is a different topic, but I refuse to believe that it's just grids and boxes. Grids and boxes are easy because everything is defined with an x and y position. But I rather have a natural structuring. What if an application is structured on a circle, and every click deeper moves you to a location further away from the center. Neighboring pages would be a rotation away from you. Maybe things don't need a fixed location at all. Anything goes. I think it would be interesting to look at posters. In how many different ways can you put information on a poster while making sure that you read the most important pieces first, and gain more detailed info if you keep looking. 

I'm a big fan of re-imaginings of what is taken for granted. I like the steam controller. I like orthogonal, split keyboards. What design layout would I like?
